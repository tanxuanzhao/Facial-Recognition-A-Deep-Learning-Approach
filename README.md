# Facial-Recognition-A-Deep-Learning-Approach
Research related to improving facial recognition models
Final Year (Capstone) Project, University Of Wollongong, October 2023 â€“ March 2024


This repository only contains code that I used and modified from an existing model to test how the modification of LeakReLU, SoftMax, Sigmoid would affect the Accuracy, Precision, Recall and Response time of the code.

Previously attempt to do external modifications such as adjusting contrast and Brightness for the images parsed in for Facial Recognition and was not favorable and was rejected by the main stakeholder the Supervising Lecturer as such modifications were done inside the model only.



Short video describing the modification of my code and what it does

* Powerpoint showcases my groups different codes and attempts to Reseach Ways to improve existing Facial Recognition models
** The project involves other code as well from other group members however it is not be uploaded in this repository as it is their work.
